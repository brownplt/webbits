Version change log.

=0.15=
Bug fixes in the pretty-printer, the parser and the QuickCheck arbitrary
instance for the AST. Refactored tests to use test-framework. Reorganized
the interface for the parser to make it consistent; see deprecation
warnings for details. Added Language.ECMAScript3.SourceDiff -- a simple
source-based differ for ECMAScript programs, which is now used for
visualizing test failures. Revised package dependencies. Factored the
analyses out in a separate package: language-ecmascript-analysis;
Language.ECMAScript3.Analysis.* are now deprecated.

=0.14=
Refactoring of the pretty-printing module: added class Pretty with a more
comprehensive coverage of AST datatypes and better documentation. Removed
duplicate code and deprecated all old interfaces (everything except class
Pretty). Old interfaces would be removed in 1.0 (still a long way out).

=0.13=
Added class PP for pretty-printing

=0.12=
Added a 'setAnnotation' function to the 'HasAnnotation' class. Added
a 'withAnnotation' helper function to modify the top level annotation.

=0.11.1=
Fixed binary operator precedence in the parser.

=0.11=
Added a simple quasi-quoter for ECMAScript (see
Language.ECMAScript3.Syntax.QuasiQuote)

=0.10=
The ParenExpr constructor was removed from the Expression AST
(WARNING: might break some builds). The pretty printer was rewritten
to automatically parenthesize sub-expressions based on operator
precedence. Added a (beta quality) arbitrary instance for all the
AST's to generate random JavaScript programs (useful for testing).


=0.9.1=
Increased the upper bound on data-default in dependencies. See
https://github.com/jswebtools/language-ecmascript/pull/5
